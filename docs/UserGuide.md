## Description

The Food Diary is a desktop app for managing food diary entries, optimized with a Command Line Interface (CLI) and packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The Food Diary caters to food-passionate NUS students who would ideally benefit from keeping records of food options tasted in the vicinity of NUS.

The Food Diary will allow students to save time and effort when finding places to 
eat around the NUS vicinity. The Food Diary especially caters to students chiefly on 3 aspects:
1. The ability for users to log personal food reviews tagged under different categories for future reference.
2. The ability to effortlessly reference food options based on relevant filters in a user-friendly GUI
3. The ability to import and export their personal food diary to share with friends.
